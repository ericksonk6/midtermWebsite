            <p>
                Founded in 2015, The Glass Egg started as the passion project of two friends who love to bake. Our co
                founders, Natialie and Rose, wake up early each morning to bake all of the baked goods and bread in house.
                The beans we use for our signature espresso and coffee drinks are locally roasted by Rose’s girlfriend Shea,
                who owns Bea’s Beans located in Fremont. Our chef Micheal, who as of 2017, has become an important part of
                The Glass Egg family. He has complete creative control over the menu and has managed to wow us with every
                dish he has crafted over the past three years. We have loved being a part of the Queen Anne neighborhood
                these past few years and are constantly looking for new ways to expand and connect with the community.
                Please feel free and fill out the form on the “Contact Us” page if you would like to work with us or learn
                more about our business.
